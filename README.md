## **1. Aim**

To demonstrate how different prompting techniques (basic prompting, zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based prompting, semantic filtering, and creative prompting) influence the generation of two distinct outputs using AI models:

1. A factual **Article on Climate Change**
2. A **Sci-Fi Short Story** (Creative Writing)

The objective is to compare how prompt structure affects **quality, coherence, creativity, and factual accuracy**.

---

## **2. Algorithm**

### **Algorithm for Exploring Prompting Techniques**

1. **Select the Content Types**

   * Article (factual, structured)
   * Sci-Fi Story (creative, narrative-driven)

2. **Choose Prompting Techniques**

   * Basic Prompt
   * Zero-Shot
   * Few-Shot
   * Chain-of-Thought
   * Role-Based Prompting
   * Semantic Filtering
   * Creative Prompting

3. **Generate Content Using Each Technique**

   * Provide prompts of each type
   * Collect outputs for both Article and Sci-Fi Story

4. **Analyze Output Quality**

   * Structure
   * Clarity
   * Creativity
   * Accuracy
   * Style consistency

5. **Compare Techniques**

   * Create comparison table
   * Identify best methods for factual vs. creative tasks

6. **Document Results**

   * Summarize findings
   * Provide final observations and recommendations

---

## **3. Procedure**

### **Step 1 – Define Topics**

* *Article Topic:* “Impact of Climate Change on Global Ecosystems”
* *Story Topic:* “A Sci-Fi Short Story About a Future Earth Affected by Climate Change”

### **Step 2 – Apply Prompt Variations**

For each prompting technique, generate both:

✔ A short article
✔ A sci-fi story segment

### **Step 3 – Evaluate Output**

Criteria:

* Accuracy (for article)
* Creativity (for story)
* Clarity and coherence
* Structure
* Style consistency

### **Step 4 – Compile Observations**

Identify how each prompting method changes the output.

## **4. Results**

### **A. Article Output Samples**

#### **1. Basic Prompt**

*“Write an article about climate change.”*
→ Output: Generic, brief, no structure, lacks depth.

#### **2. Zero-Shot Prompt**

*“Write a structured article explaining the impact of climate change on global ecosystems.”*
→ Output: Better structure, includes sections like causes/effects.

#### **3. Few-Shot Prompt**

Examples are provided first.
→ Output: Strong, highly structured, consistent academic tone.

#### **4. Chain-of-Thought Prompt**

*“Explain step-by-step how climate change affects ecosystems, then produce an article.”*
→ Output: Very clear reasoning, highly factual and coherent.

#### **5. Role-Based Prompting**

*“Act as a climate scientist and write an article…”*
→ Output: Professional tone, technical accuracy improves.

#### **6. Semantic Filtering**

*“Write an article in a formal, concise tone with subheadings.”*
→ Output: More polished, cleaner structure.

---

### **B. Sci-Fi Story Output Samples**

#### **1. Basic Prompt**

*“Write a sci-fi story about climate change.”*
→ Output: Simple plot, minimal world-building.

#### **2. Zero-Shot**

*“Write a sci-fi short story set in a future Earth affected by climate change.”*
→ Output: More imaginative, clearer setting.

#### **3. Few-Shot**

Add 2 sample story openings.
→ Output: Strong narrative voice, improved character depth.

#### **4. Chain-of-Thought**

*“Explain the story arc (intro, conflict, resolution), then write the story.”*
→ Output: Best structure and pacing among all methods.

#### **5. Role-Based**

*“Act as a professional sci-fi author…”*
→ Output: More vivid descriptions, sophisticated language.

#### **6. Creative Prompting**

*“Write a cinematic, imaginative story using sensory details.”*
→ Output: Most imaginative and emotionally engaging.

## **5. Comparison Table**

| Prompting Technique    | Climate Change Article       | Sci-Fi Story                  | Strengths                    | Weaknesses                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Basic Prompting**    | Very generic                 | Basic plot                    | Fast, simple                 | Low depth and quality     |
| **Zero-Shot**          | Structured, informative      | Creative ideas appear         | Good default quality         | May lack refinement       |
| **Few-Shot**           | Well-organized, professional | Strong narrative voice        | Mimics high-quality examples | Requires longer prompts   |
| **Chain-of-Thought**   | Best logical clarity         | Best plot structure           | Excellent reasoning          | Can be lengthy            |
| **Role-Based**         | Sounds expert                | Complex and rich storytelling | Good tone control            | May hallucinate expertise |
| **Semantic Filtering** | Very clean and polished      | Style consistency             | Good for academic writing    | Restricts creativity      |
| **Creative Prompting** | Less fitting                 | Most imaginative              | Ideal for artistic output    | Poor for factual accuracy |

## **6. Discussion**

* For **articles**, the strongest results come from:
  **Few-Shot + Chain-of-Thought + Role-Based**
  These ensure accuracy, structure, and authoritative tone.

* For **creative stories**, the best results come from:
  **Role-Based + Creative Prompting + Chain-of-Thought**
  These improve imagination, world-building, and narrative structure.

* Basic prompting is not sufficient for high-quality output.

* Semantic filtering is excellent for controlling tone but reduces creativity.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The study demonstrates that **prompting style greatly influences AI-generated content**.

* **Factual tasks (articles)** benefit from structured, reasoning-based prompts.
* **Creative tasks (sci-fi stories)** benefit from imaginative or role-based prompts.

In both cases, **Chain-of-Thought** consistently provides the most coherent structure, while **Few-Shot** ensures style consistency.

Thus, choosing the correct prompting technique is essential for achieving **high-quality, purpose-specific output**.
